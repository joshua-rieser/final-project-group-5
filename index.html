        <h1>1. 	Impact on Public Perception</h1>   
        <h2>Fact & Supporting materials</h2>
        <h3><u>Example of Impact:</u> During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, fake visuals and news stories about candidates were widespread. These fake visuals influenced public opinion and voting behaviour, showcasing how manipulated content can distort public perception.
        </h3>
        <h4>Ref: Faris, R., Roberts, H., Etling, B., Bourassa, N., Zuckerman, E., & Benkler, Y. (2017). Partisanship, propaganda, and disinformation: Online media and the 2016 US presidential election. <i>Berkman Klein Center Research Publication.</i>
        </h4>     
        <h3><u>Research Evidence:</u> Studies have shown that people are more likely to believe information accompanied by visuals, even if those visuals are fake (Pennycook & Rand, 2019). This highlights how visuals can enhance the perceived credibility of false information.
        </h3>
        <h4>Ref: Pennycook, G., & Rand, D. G. (2019). Fighting misinformation on social media using crowdsourced judgments of news source quality. <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,</i> 116(7), 2521-2526.
        </h4> 
        <h2>Arguments & Disagreements</h2>
        <h3><u>Supporting Evidence:</u> Studies, such as Pennycook and Rand (2019), show that people tend to believe visuals more than text, which can distort reality.
        </h3>  
        <h3><u>Opposing Viewpoint:</u> Critics argue that the public is becoming more media literate and skeptical of visual content, reducing the impact of fake visuals. For instance, a report by the Pew Research Center (2019) found that an increasing number of people are aware of the prevalence of fake news and are more critical of the media they consume.

        <h1>2. Fake Visuals Spread False Information Rapidly</h1>   
        <h2>Fact & Supporting materials</h2>
        <h3><u>Viral Nature of Visuals:</u> Visual content is shared more frequently and quickly on social media compared to text-only content. A single fake image can go viral, reaching millions within hours.
        </h3>
        <h4>Ref: Vosoughi, S., Roy, D., & Aral, S. (2018). The spread of true and false news online. <i>Science,</i> 359(6380), 1146-1151.
        </h4>     
        <h3><u>Real-World Example:</u> During natural disasters, fake images showing exaggerated damage or false rescue operations often go viral, leading to misdirected public and governmental responses. For instance, fake images during Hurricane Sandy spread rapidly, causing confusion and panic.
        </h3>
        <h4>Ref: Associated Press. (2012). Fake hurricane Sandy photos fool social media users. <i>USA Today.</i>
        </h4> 
        <h2>Arguments & Disagreements</h2>
        <h3><u>Supporting Evidence:</u> Visual content is shared more frequently on social media, as seen in the rapid spread of fake images during events like natural disasters (Vosoughi et al., 2018).
        </h3>  
        <h3><u>Opposing Viewpoint:</u> Some experts argue that the rapid spread of information on social media can be both a curse and a blessing. According to McCright and Dunlap (2011), the same mechanisms that spread fake visuals can also be used to disseminate corrective information quickly, potentially mitigating the damage.

        <h1>3. Undermining the Reliability of Journalism</h1>   
        <h2>Fact & Supporting materials</h2>
        <h3><u>Erosion of Trust:</u> When fake visuals are mistakenly broadcasted by reputable news outlets, it severely damages their credibility. For example, BBC and CNN have both been caught using incorrect images, leading to public backlash and reduced trust.
        </h3>
        <h4>Ref: Newman, N., Fletcher, R., Schulz, A., Andı, S., Robertson, C. T., & Nielsen, R. K. (2020). Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2020. <i>Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.</i>
        </h4>     
        <h3><u>Long-Term Impact:</u> A study by the Reuters Institute found that repeated exposure to fake news decreases overall trust in news media, making it harder for people to discern between reliable and unreliable sources (Newman et al., 2020).
        </h3>
        <h4>Ref: Newman, N., Fletcher, R., Kalogeropoulos, A., Levy, D. A. L., & Nielsen, R. K. (2017). Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2017. <i>Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.</i>
        </h4> 
        <h2>Arguments & Disagreements</h2>
        <h3><u>Supporting Evidence:</u> Instances of reputable news outlets broadcasting fake images have led to public backlash and reduced trust (Newman et al., 2020).
        </h3>  
        <h3><u>Opposing Viewpoint:</u> Opponents like Wardle and Derakhshan (2017) argue that the impact of fake visuals on trust in journalism is not as significant as claimed. They suggest that journalism has always faced challenges to its credibility, and the current issues with fake visuals are part of a broader media ecosystem that has always included misinformation.

        <h1>4. Technological Advancements Enable Complex False Visuals</h1>   
        <h2>Fact & Supporting materials</h2>
        <h3><u>Ease of Creation:</u> With the advent of user-friendly software, creating realistic fake images and videos (deepfakes) has become accessible to the public. Tools like Adobe Photoshop and even mobile apps allow for sophisticated manipulations.
        </h3>
        <h4>Ref: Chesney, B., & Citron, D. (2019). Deepfakes and the new disinformation war: The coming age of post-truth geopolitics. <i>Foreign Affairs.</i>
        </h4>     
        <h3><u>Cost-Effectiveness:</u> Previously, creating high-quality fake visuals required significant resources. Today, it can be done with minimal investment, making it easier for malicious actors to produce and distribute fake content.

        <h4>Ref: Paris, B., & Donovan, J. (2019). Deepfakes and Cheapfakes: The Manipulation of Audio and Visual Evidence. <i>Data & Society.</i>
        </h4> 
        <h2>Arguments & Disagreements</h2>
        <h3><u>Supporting Evidence:</u> The accessibility and cost-effectiveness of creating realistic fake visuals have increased, as discussed by Chesney and Citron (2019).
        </h3>  
        <h3><u>Opposing Viewpoint:</u> Some believe that advancements in technology also include improvements in detecting fake visuals. Techniques such as blockchain for verifying the authenticity of visual content and AI-driven detection tools are becoming more sophisticated, as noted by Hwang and Ullman (2020).

            <h2>Fact & Supporting materials</h2>
            <h3><u>Incitement of Violence:</u> Fake visuals can incite violence and unrest. For instance, a doctored video in 2019 purportedly showing Muslim men celebrating after a terrorist attack went viral, leading to real-world violence and heightened communal tensions.

            </h4>     
            <h3><u>Public Health Misinformation:</u> During the COVID-19 pandemic, fake visuals about treatments, vaccine side effects, and the severity of the virus spread misinformation, causing people to make dangerous health decisions based on false information.

            </h4> 
            <h2>Arguments & Disagreements</h2>
            <h3><u>Supporting Evidence:</u> Fake visuals can incite violence and spread misinformation, as seen in cases like the doctored video of Nancy Pelosi (Silverman, 2019).
            </h3>  
            <h3><u>Opposing Viewpoint:</u> Critics argue that the extent to which fake visuals pose a public safety threat is often exaggerated. They point to the resilience of democratic institutions and the role of law enforcement in addressing the consequences of such misinformation (Flynn et al., 2017).
